# MLM
---
This repository contains the homeworks and documentation of the Mathematics of Machine Learning 2022 course, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, given by professor [Francisco GÃ³mez](https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/).

The main idea of this repo is store and document the homeworks made in the MML course, make it easaly to replicate and to apply the methods, and also learn about more Julia. 

In this time, we are going to use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language, since is friendly to write and very fast. To execute this repository you must have installed Julia and some of its libraries (chek the [Requirements.txt](https://github.com/saguileran/MLM/blob/main/Requirements.txt) file), and  Jupyter-Notebook or Jupyter Lab (Anaconda is recomended). Note: To see all the plots correclty you must have installed [PlotlyJS](https://plotly.com/julia/) library on Julia, and it must work correctly.
