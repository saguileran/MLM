# Mathematics of Machine Learning (MLM)
---

This repository contains the homeworks and documentation of the course Mathematics of Machine Learning 2022, at the National University of Colombia, dictated by Professor [Francisco GÃ³mez](https://sites.google.com/site/fagomezj/).

The main idea of this repository is to store and document the assignments done in the MML course, in order to facilitate the replication and application of the methods, as well as to learn more about Julia. 

In this occasion, we are going to use the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/), due to its ease of writing and speed. To run this repository you must have Julia and some of its libraries installed (check the [Requirements.txt](https://github.com/saguileran/MLM/blob/main/Requirements.txt) file), as well as Jupyter-Notebook or Jupyter Lab (Anaconda is recommended) to run the notebooks. 

**Note**: To see all the graphics correctly you must have the [PlotlyJS](https://plotly.com/julia/) library installed in Julia, and it should work correctly.
